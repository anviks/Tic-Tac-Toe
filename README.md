# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Rust. 
It is a console application and is intended to be run in a terminal. 
The game is played on a 3x3 grid and the first player to get three of their marks in a row 
(horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. 
If the grid is full and no player has won, the game is a draw.
